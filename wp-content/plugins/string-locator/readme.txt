Find and edit code in your themes and plugins

== Description ==

When working on themes and plugins you often notice a piece of text that appears hardcoded into the files, you need to modify it, but you don't know where it's located in the theme files.

Easily search through your themes, plugins or the WordPress core and be presented with a list of files, the matched text and what line of the file matched your search.
You can then quickly make edits directly in your browser by clicking the link from the search results.

By default a Smart-Scan is enabled when making edits, this will look for inconsistencies with braces, brackets and parenthesis that are often accidentally left.
This drastically reduces the risk of breaking your site when making edits, but is not an absolute guarantee.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Will Smart-Scan guarantee my site is safe when making edits? =
Although it will do it's best at detecting incorrect usage of the commonly used symbols (parenthesis, brackets and braces), there is no guarantee every possible error is detected. The best safe guard is to keep consistent backups of your site (even when not making edits).

As of version 1.6, the plugin will check your site health after performing an edit. If the site is returning a site breaking error code, we'll revert to the previous version of the file.

1. Searching through the Twenty Fourteen theme for the string 'not found'
2. Having clicked the link for one of the results and being taken to the editor in the browser
